# PGP Key ID Miner
Generate the PGP Key ID you want.

## Why?

Short IDs are insecure because they can be easily collided, so we need to use long IDs. But why not collide a convenient ID of your own to make long IDs just as easy to read and remember as they are to confirm?

`A3A7 1230 AABB CCDD` is easier to identify than `9710 B89B CA57 AD7C`. And there is no difference in security.
